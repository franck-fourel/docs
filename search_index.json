is hard. Like, really freaking hard. üòì\nWhat are some of the things that make it hard? A short list: DST, frequent cross-timezone travel, and technology like smart phones and browsers operating in an always locale-aware manner. This is @jebeck's handy guide to the most common situations at Tidepool where you'll have to handle datetimes and the best strategies for doing so.\nPrerequisites\nWe need to start with the same vocabulary, as some terms are similar but the differences between them can be crucial. Before continuing with this guide, review the following terms in the glossary:\n\nBtUTC\ncalendar date\nclock time\ndatetime\nDST\nhammertime\nISO 8601\ntimezone\ntimezone offset\nUnix time\nUTC\n\nIt is also essential for those handling datetimes on diabetes devices for ingestion into the Tidepool platform to review the falsehoods Tidepoolers (want to) believe about diabetes device times. (It is certainly advisable for those handling datetimes on diabetes data in the client(s) to review this list as well, but it isn't quite as essential.)\nIn addition to these prerequisites, here are a few readings and videos that are also well worth study, though maybe not all at once:\n\nFalsehoods programmers believe about timea\n\n\nThe guide(s)\nThe first key takeaway is that there is not one guide to datetimes at Tidepool. There are three: three distinct guides for three quite distinct situations. Or really, three distinct types of datetimes that are encountered regularly in the Tidepool codebase. So the first question a Tidepool engineer should ask themself is, \"What kind of datetime am I trying to manipulate?\" Then look at the appropriate guide below:\n\nguide to handling diabetes data: This is the big one, naturally given Tidepool's mission. If you are dealing with a time or a deviceTime from a datum conforming to the Tidepool data model, this is the guide for you!\nguide to handling browser-local datetimes in the present moment (i.e., nows): If you're trying to manipulate the datetime representing a user's action in the present moment‚Äîthat is, a \"now\"‚Äîthen this is the guide you want.\nguide to handling user-significant calendar dates: If you're working with any calendar date stored in the user's profile (as of May 2017, these are birthday and diagnosisDate), look at this guide.\n\n\na. Hat tip to @darinkrauss for linking this one in the Tidepool Slack! ‚Ü©\n\n"},"datetime/diabetes-data.html":{"url":"datetime/diabetes-data.html","title":"diabetes data datetimes","keywords":"","body":"Handling datetimes in diabetes data\nTable of contents\n\nBackground\nHandling diabetes data datetimes on ingestion\nHandling diabetes data datetimes in the client(s)\n\nBackground\nThe storage of datetimes on actual physical diabetes devices is, in short, üí©. If you can imagine a way to store datetimes badlya, we've probably seen it at Tidepool.\nTo start, no diabetes device that we know of stores the datetimes of events that occur on the device in UTC (the standard on üåé) or in a fashion that is anchored to UTC, with the possible exception of an iPhone serving as a receiver for a Dexcom G5 CGM (depending on how hair-splitty you want to get about the term \"diabetes device\"). Since UTC is the üåç standard and the only standard that allows for aligning data from multiple devices on the same timeline reliably, this presents a problem.\nAt Tidepool, aligning data from multiple devices on the same timeline reliably is core to our product, so we have implemented an algorithm (known around these parts by the abbrevaition BtUTC) to infer the UTC datetime from the relative datetimes stored on diabetes devices. This algorithm adds several properties to each datum in the Tidepool data model, and for the purposes of this document, it's not the hows of the calculation of these properties that is important, but rather what a few of them represent and can be used for:\n\ntime is the inferred, ISO 8601-formatted UTC datetime of the event\ndeviceTime is an ISO 8601-formatted version of the original datetime stored on the diabetes device; that is, Tidepool only reformatted this value, but did not otherwise change it in any way\ntimezoneOffset is the inferred timezone offset for the event\n\ndeviceTime is a relative value to the user's local timezone, but prior to running BtUTC, none of the timezone information needed to anchor the datetime on the absolute scale of UTC is available; rather, this information is hidden or latent. (@jebeck has a fondness for referring to such datetimes as \"timezone-na√Øve,\" though this is a perhaps a too liberal stretch of the meaning of \"na√Øve.\" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)\nThe latent timezone offset value accompanying a deviceTime is what is inferred by the BtUTC algorithm and then used to calculate the UTC time value. In other words, time is the result of taking a relative datetime in deviceTime and subtracting the inferred timezoneOffset in order to convert the datetime to the absolute UTC scale:\ntime = deviceTime - timezoneOffset\nFor example, a deviceTime of midnight on January 1st, 2017 for a user uploading then with their device aligning with the US/Pacific timezone would result in an inferred timezoneOffset of -480, and therefore:\n2017-01-01T08:00:00.000Z = 2017-01-01T00:00:00 - -480\nMore precisely as a computer would perform this calculation, having parsed the first two String representations into integer hammertimes:\n1483257600000 = 1483228800000 - -28800000\nThis equation is true in the vast majority of cases, but there are slightly more complex edge cases as well, but those are not relevant outside of the BtUTC algorithm itself, so the interested or needful reader should refer to the BtUTC technical documentation for further details.\nThe storage protocols for datetimes on diabetes devices isn't even the only source of problems in handling them. The PwD's behavior in managing their devices' display time also causes complications. The user interfaces on many diabetes devices are not designed well, so aside from inattention, errors sometimes occur because they are easier to make in the interface than non-errors.\nIn general, it is good to approach diabetes device times with a very, very small set of assumptions. In other words, avoid all of this list of assumptions, which have been proven false in one way or another (and often repeatedly) at Tidepool.\nHandling diabetes data datetimes on ingestion\nIf the only thing an engineer implementing the protocol to read data from a diabetes device needed to know about handling datetimes properly was \"run the BtUTC algorithm,\" then there wouldn't be much of a need for this section. As the reader may have guessed already, BtUTC gets you most of the way there, but not all the way. There is at least one situation‚Äîplus BtUTC edge cases and bugs‚Äîthat will still require the engineer working on data ingestion to manipulate diabetes device datetimes directly.\nSchedule lookup\nBasal schedules and other insulin pump settings are based on a schedule that is expressed in device local time. When a user changes their device's display time setting, the schedule will follow the new display time rather than shifting.\nThe implications of this when ingesting device data are that in situations where the ingestion process needs to look up information from a currently active schedule in the currently active device settings, the ingestion engineer must translate the event's post-BtUTC time back to a deviceTime (i.e., a \"display time\") in order to look up which segment of the currently active schedule the event falls into.\nHandling diabetes data datetimes in the client(s)\nIn the client, the guideline for handling diabetes data datetimes is quite simple: use the time field in the Tidepool data model, in combination with the user's configured timezone preferences.\nWhen using Moment.js to manipulate and/or display diabetes device datetimes using the time field in the Tidepool data model, in every case your usage should begin with moment.utc(time).tz(timezone). For good examples of this, refer to viz's datetime utilities.\n\n\na. Not pathologically or maliciously badly. Just, you know, poorly. ‚Ü©\n\n"},"datetime/falsehoods.html":{"url":"datetime/falsehoods.html","title":"falsehoods re: diabetes data datetimes","keywords":"","body":"Falsehoods Tidepoolers (want to) believe about diabetes device times\n\nthe display time on a PwD's device will be accurate to their local time\nOK, maybe not, but it will be pretty close (within minutes)\nOK, maybe sometimes it will be an hour off because of a DST changeover\nOK, maybe not, but the PwD will definitely remember to change the display time before the next DST changeover\nOK, maybe not, but the display time on a PwD's device won't be a month off\nOK, maybe not, but it won't be a year off\nOK, maybe not, but it won't be a decade offa\nOK, maybe not, but it won't be in the future\nOK, maybe not, but it won't possibly ever be January 1st, 2007 or January 1st, 2008 if the PwD didn't get the device until 2015, surelyb\nno two (or more) events will share the exact same datetime\nif a stored time field on the events from a diabetes device looks like a Unix time, it is a Unix time\n\n\n\na.

Production releases are tied to git tags. (In our ops system, it is only possible to build and deploy an app or service from a tag.)\nWhen making a change in any repository (whether developing a new feature or fixing a bug), our convention is to create a new branch with the name / - e.g., jebeck/new-signup-flow or jebeck/bugfix-form-validation. The backend team occasionally uses sprint-based branch names - e.g., jh-bate/sprint25 or jh-bate/sprint25-clinic-roles.\nAll significant changes should be made through a pull request that is approved by another Tidepool developer through a process of code review. We often use LGTM \"looks good to me\" as our approval sign-off at the conclusion of a review and/or one or more rounds of feedback and changes. One of the following (or any similarly unambiguous) emoji is also acceptable as sign-off:  (:ship:),  (:thumbsup:), or the GitHub \"ship it squirrel\"  (:shipit:,:squirrel:).\nWhat constitutes a significant change? In essence, it's anything that could potentially affect the user experience (though perhaps indirectly). It's probably easier, however, to just list the few things that are not significant changes:\n\nupdates to dev-only dependencies\nchanges to dev-only tooling (dev tools like the dev server for client-side apps, test runners, CI configuration)\nchanges to the README or documentation\n\nChanges such as these that are not significant should still be made through a pull request, but the developer opening the pull request may merge the PR without code review and sign-off. Opening a pull request in these cases serves to make other developers aware of the changes made. The developer opening the pull request may also wish to leave the pull request open for a small amount of time for potential commenting and/or requests for changes. Our convention is to @-mention any other developers we would like to notify of the changes and give a period of time that the pull request will be open for comment before merge. For example:\n\n@gniezen, does this look OK to you? Merging in twenty-four hours if no comment üòé\n\nNote that the following things, which may seem insignificant, are subject to code review (and QA):\n\nupdates to production dependencies\nchanges to production build tooling\nchanges to the production static server (for client apps like blip)\n\nSometimes we open a pull request before code is ready for review if we want another developer to take a look at the code progress so far. (GitHub's interface for viewing diffs being one of the easiest ways to do this.) In such cases, the PR should be clearly marked as a work-in-progress - e.g., WIP. Don't merge! If you open a WIP pull request, please remember to remove the WIP warning language when the PR is ready for review and merge.\nContinuous Integration\nIn the vast majority of our app, service, and library repositories, if not all of them, we use the Travis continuous integration service, integrated with GitHub, to run linting and tests on every push and pull request. When you open a pull request, if Travis reports a failure, your first task will be to fix whatever caused it to fail (linting, tests, or both). Anyone you've asked to review a PR may decline to do so until Travis is happy. Conversely, if someone has asked you to review a PR and Travis is in a sad/angry/&c state, you may decline to begin reviewing until whatever Travis is choking on has been fixed.\nYou should also wait for Travis to report back happily on a tag push before deploying the tag. (Exception: it's a known non-RC, tagged as such, and only being deployed to the dev environment.)\nMerging\nOur conventions for merging pull requests vary - that is, whether the code reviewer does it, or whether the code reviewer signs off and then waits for the PR opener to do it. The strategy employed in any given situation depends on how many things are in flight in the repository, the priority of sprint goals for production releases, etc. Communicate clearly with your teammates about who's going to merge and when.\nAfter a pull request is merged, the branch should be deleted. (We also periodically clean up stale branches in each repository, and it is here that the developer-based branch naming convention is particularly helpful because it ensures that everyone knows who to ask about whether a stale branch needs to be kept or can be deleted.)\nRebasing\nWe follow the general guideline of \"don't rewrite history.\" Rebasing to reorder, squash, or otherwise fix commits locally before a branch or a set of commits has been pushed upstream is perfectly acceptable, but once commits are upstream you shouldn't mess with them (by rebasing or by any other means).\nIf you have a strong need to rebase a branch that has already been pushed upstream, a good strategy is to create a new branch with a \"version number\" increment. For example, from darinkrauss/custodial-accounts create darinkrauss/custodial-accounts.2, rebase as necessary before pushing darinkrauss/custodial-accounts.2 upstream, then delete darinkrauss/custodial-accounts from the upstream repo.\nTags\nWe \"cut\" tags in two situations, the first far more common than the second:\n\nwhen we think we have a release candidate of an app or service\nwhen we know we don't have a release candidate of an app or service, but we want to deploy what we have so far to demo it or make it available for developer use\n\nIn the first situation, we create the tag after merging the pull request(s) for the new feature(s) or fix(es) to master. In the second situation, we create the tag on the working feature branch. We use semantic versioning for the first type of tag (the uploader is an exception, since the Chrome store does not support patch-level version increments), and most of us use the tool mversion to create these tags in a consistent way. You can bump the minor version for an uploader release, for example, with the command mversion minor -m and this will bump the version in both the package.json and the manifest.json (for the Chrome store), as well as commit those changes, named the commit with the new version number, and create the git tag. We typically distinguish the second type of tag from the first to make it very clear that the \"demo\" tag is not a release candidate, either by adding a post-fix (e.g., v0.12.0-alpha) or by using a named tag instead of a semver-based tag (e.g., clinic-accts-beta).\nWe also - very rarely - deploy from a tag made on a \"hotfix\" branch. This happens when an urgent bugfix needs to made, but changes have already been merged into master that are not ready for release. In such situations, we branch off the previous actual production release tag (e.g., v0.5.0), fix the bug on the branch and tag on the branch (bumping the patch number from the previous release and adding a post-fix to identify the tag as a \"hotfix\" tag: v0.5.1-hotfix). After the hotfix release, we may choose to merge the bugfix branch into master, or we may re-implement or copy over the bugfix changes in another way, depending on how the bugfix fits (or doesn't) with the code on master.\nWhen you cut a tag, you should fill out the release notes for the tag via GitHub's interface for this at https://github.com/tidepool-org/[repo]/releases/new. Look at prior releases for an idea of how verbose these usually are (not very). If the tag is not a release candidate, check the \"This is a pre-release\" box.\n"},"front-end/":{"url":"front-end/","title":"front-end @ Tidepool","keywords":"","body":"front-end @ Tidepool\nTable of contents\n\nRepositories and published packages\nCommon tech stack and usage\nReact @ Tidepool\nRedux @ Tidepool\n\n\nDeveloper guides\nblip\nchrome-uploader\nviz\n\n\nMiscellaneous recipes\n\n\n\nRepositories and published packages\nTidepool has several repositories containing client-side JavaScript code in support of two client applications on the Tidepool platform, blip and the Tidepool uploader.

The open-source community provides some great middleware options like the redux-logger that we include behind an environment variable to assist in development.\nIf you're unfamiliar with the concept of middleware, the section of the redux documentation dedicated to middleware is a well-written, easily-understood thing of beauty. Go read it.\nFor our use cases at Tidepool, we are currently employing two custom middlewares. Thus far, these are only fully in use in the Chrome uploader and used for just a few metrics and API errors in blip.\nMetrics Middleware\nThe metrics middleware inspects each action that flows through it to see if the action has a metric object inside the meta property of the action. (See Standardized Actions below for an explanation of the meta property.) If the action does have an object at meta.metric, then the middleware calls the Tidepool metrics endpoint with data extracted from metric.eventName and metric.properties.\nIn the Chrome uploader, the intersection between \"things we want metrics for\" and \"events that are already part of the redux implementation\" is nearly perfect; the only exception is the need for an action creator connected to the link to launch blip in a browser window, which does not affect the uploader's state at all and so would not normally need an action creator for the reducers to respond to and effect change in the store.\nIn blip, the intersection between \"things we want metrics for\" and \"events that are already part of the redux implementation\" is much smaller, which is why we're only using a metrics middleware for a few metrics.\nError Logging Middleware\nThe error logging middleware inspects each action that flows through it to see if the action has its error property set to true. If so, then the middleware calls the Tidepool metrics endpoint with data extracted from the action payload (which will be an Error object according to our Standardized Actions) as well as data extracted from metric inside the meta property as above.\n"},"front-end/redux/directory-structure.html":{"url":"front-end/redux/directory-structure.html","title":"directory structure","keywords":"","body":"Directory Structure & Naming\nWe have made an effort to standardized our directory structure and naming of files across repositories where we have a redux implementation.

The existence of this utility was a big factor in our decision to adopt FSA since a standard that isn't (easily) enforceable isn't much good at all. Accordingly - and as noted in Testing Strategies - we include a test to prove that each action created by our action creators passes isFSA in our redux unit tests.\nThere has been some controversy around the way that FSA handles errors, and we at Tidepool agree with @gajus that it would be better to put the Error object in the error field of an action, leaving the payload free to contain other information that might be needed to effect a change in the app's store.

There are a few tips & tricks necessary to do this most efficiently and take full advantage of our front-end developer tools, like webpack hot module replacement.\nA: Running the platform locally with runservers but blip with hot module replacement (HMR) via webpack\n\nStart up the platform locally using runservers (cf. starting services)\nKill the blip process runservers that spun up with kill $TP_blip\nIn a fresh terminal tab or window, navigate to your local clone of blip and source the local config with source config/local.sh\nNow start up blip with HMR using npm start\nWhen you're done working, remember to tp_kill -9 to properly dispose of all the processes started by runservers (a plain tp_kill will not get all of them!)\n\nB: Changing the MINIMUM_UPLOADER_VERSION in jellyfish locally\nIn the Chrome uploader, we check - both on launch of the app and at the start of any upload attempt - whether the user's uploader is at or above the MINIMUM_UPLOADER_VERSION configured in the jellyfish data ingestion service. In order to work on the UI for the error displayed to a user when their uploader is out-of-date, you need to be able to change the MINIMUM_UPLOADER_VERSION jellyfish has configured, preferably without killing and restarting the entire runservers bundle of processes each time you make a change to the configuration! Here's how to do that:\n\nStart up the platform locally using runservers\nWhen you want to change the MINIMUM_UPLOADER_VERSION, open up the runservers file from your local copy of the tools and comment out all the function calls starting with tp_warmup then tp_mongo etc. at the bottom of the file\nHigher up in the file in the definition of the tp_jellyfish function, edit the MINIMUM_UPLOADER_VERSION as desired\nRe-source the runservers file in your terminal with source tools/runservers\nRestart the jellyfish service with tp_restart jellyfish2\n\nC: Working on the UI for API error states in the uploader or blip\nOne of the nice things about running the whole platform locally is that it's fairly easy to work on the UI for the surfacing of API errors in our client apps. There are a couple strategies for this.\nModify tidepool-platform-client locally\nSince API calls (currently!) go through the tidepool-platform-client, you can just pull down a clone of platform-client and edit the appropriate API wrapping function(s) to always return an error. From within your client app directory, use the following commands to depend on your local platform-client instead of the version installed from npm:\n$ rm -rf node_modules/tidepool-platform-client/\n$ npm link ../platform-client\n\nModify a service locally\nYou can also modify one (or more) of the backend services locally to return an error response to whatever call(s) you're working on. @jebeck typically does this to work on surfacing an error from the check against jellyfish's /info endpoint (which returns jellyfish's configured MINIMUM_UPLOADER_VERSION among other things). The workflow for this is as follows:\n\nStart up the platform locally using runservers\nIn your local copy of the service repo, make the change(s) to the endpoint(s) to return an error in response to all calls to that endpoint\nRestart the service from your runservers session with tp_restart $SERVICE\nWhen you're done, just clear your changes and tp_restart $SERVICE again to restore the normal behavior of the service\n\nD: Running against the dev environment\nIf you don't source a configuration file in blip, then when you use npm start, blip will configure itself by default for the dev environment. You still access blip (with HMR) at http://localhost:3000, but you can log in with any account you've set up on the dev environment. Depending on what you're working on, this is almost as good of a developer experience as running everything locally (just a bit slower, of course), and it's a good idea to set up a set of accounts for yourself on dev containing sample diabetes data from various devices and various configurations of account ownership and sharing relationships.\nE: Verifying an e-mail address without sending an e-mail\nIf you're running locally and don't have the ability to send an e-mail in order to\nget the link to verify an e-mail address, you can still accomplish this by extracting the\nrelevant information out of your local MongoDB instance. Once you have gone through the\ninitial account sign-up process, we get into our DB to grab our signupKey.\n> use hydrophone\n> db.confirmations.find({'email':}, {_id:1})\n\nThis should return you an object containing just the _id string you're interested in\n(this is just an example):\n{ \"_id\" : \"uyo_2kWWRGLZ9i3xek2reAnBeTtWWvTZ\" }\nCopy that string and construct a URL as such: (again, just an example assuming you're\nrunning Blip in a default configuration - use the id string you got from the database)\n http://localhost:3000/login?signupKey=uyo_2kWWRGLZ9i3xek2reAnBeTtWWvTZ\nOpen this URL in your browser and you can complete the signup for your new user with the\ne-mail verified. If you wish to confirm a successful verification, you can check the\ndatabase to see that status on the confirmation is completed:\n> db.confirmations.find({'email':}, {status:1})\n{ \"_id\" : \"uyo_2kWWRGLZ9i3xek2reAnBeTtWWvTZ\", \"status\" : \"completed\" }\n\nAlternatively, very soon (i.e., once the custodial user account creation work is on master) you will also be able to extract the signupKey from your local server logs. The log message will look something like:\n2016/04/20 10:00:00 Sending email confirmation to you@email.com with key DXGNhyfzbcLpxwJ7BvtrfeeTOcvgabcd\nF: Working with the Local Database\nWorking with your local mongo database is pretty easy via the mongo Shell, but here are a couple of very common recipes to get started.\nDeleting all local device data\nThe only tricky part here is the fact that the database containing diabetes device data is called streams on localhost. From the mongo shell (accessible with the mongo command when you have the whole platform running locally):\n> use streams\n> db.deviceData.remove({});\n\nTo delete just a single user's data, also a common task, you can modify the object passed to remove() with the properties you want to match, such as userid.\nCompletely wiping your local mongo\nIf you ever want to start with a completely fresh mongo3, the following JavaScript, when saved as a local file, can be fed as the first argument to the mongo command while the whole platform is running in order to delete all Tidepool-generated databases.\nvar mg = new Mongo();\n\nvar ourDbs = [\n  'gate',\n  'hydrophone',\n  'local',\n  'messages',\n  'streams',\n  'user',\n  'oauth_test',\n  'test_ingestion',\n  'test_messages',\n  'test_streams',\n  'user_test'\n];\n\nfor (var i = 0; i \n\n1.

Where that documented knowledge is useful outside of the context of the code, consider moving that knowledge to external documentation or at least providing a link from the external documentation to the inline comments.\nExternal documentation\nExternal documentation should communicate big-picture concepts, architecture, design, algorithms, and larger implementation details.\nExternal documentation should:\n\nBe written in GitHub-style Markdown.\nBe committed to the GitHub repository most closely associated with the topic.\nBe located \"as close as possible\" to the related code.\nThe preferred location is the README.md file in the parent directory of the code.\nAdditional required files (e.g. multiple large topics, images, supporting files) should be stored in the docs directory in the parent directory.\nThe README.md should reference any additional required files.\nImages should be exported as PNG.\nOriginal source files (e.g. Photoshop or SVG source for PNG) should also be stored in the docs directory.\n\n\n\n\nConsider using diagrams and graphics to communicate more clearly than words.\nInclude a root README.md that references all other README.md files in the repository.\nIf the repository is one that uses GitBook for building a static website (hosted on GitHub Pages) of the documentation, the SUMMARY.md will contain the references to all other documentation, but the README.md should still link into the top-level documentation sections (since it gets built as the index.html of the GitBook-generated static site).\n\n\nBe DRY. If the information exists elsewhere, refer to that, do not repeat. For example, include links to any associated Trello cards rather than duplicating information.\nConsider the docs repository as the starting point of all documentation that should:\nInclude a root README.md that references all other documentation in the repository and all documentation in other GitHub repositories.\nInclude documentation that does not naturally belong in another GitHub repository.\n\n\n\nSuggested topics\nConsider the following topics for each piece of external (i.e., not inline) documentation:\n\nBrief description\nArchitectural and design overview\nUser experience\nConsider referring to related UX design files and documents.\n\n\nModule, component, and code organization\nConsider using simple diagrams to communicate more effectively than words for such things as a React component hierarchy.\n\n\nExternal code dependencies, integrations, and relationships\nKnown issues, edge cases, caveats, gotchas, hacks, tech debt, and bugs\nBugs should be fully documented in a Trello card and referenced here.\n\n\nDeprecation notes\n\nUse your best judgement when documenting. Obviously, not all documentation will neatly fit into these topics.

GitBook is a tool for generating a static documentation website (with built-in search) from a set of Markdown files (which are handily thus natively renderable by the GitHub online interface). We use GitHub Pages to publish the GitBook-generated static assets on the web at various paths under the base URL of our developer microsite at http://developer.tidepool.io/. If you need to add or update the docs in this repo or in another repo that employs GitBook for publishing documentation, follow the instructions below.\nJump to...\n\nSetting up your repo to work on docs\nAdding or updating docs\nPublishing docs\n\nSetting up your repo to work on docs\nWhen we at Tidepool first set up our docs workflow using GitBook, there was only one way to set up GitHub Pages for a project: putting the static assets (HTML, CSS, etc.) you wanted GitHub to serve as your GitHub Pages site on a branch in your repository named gh-pages. This method of building a GitHub Pages site still exists, and it's what we still use at Tidepoola. Every time we update the static assets on the gh-pages branch and push to the GitHub remote repository, our project page is updated to serve the new static files.\nThe workflow for managing one's static assets when the method of publishing is the gh-pages branch is a little unintuitive since the code on the gh-pages branch (a bunch of HTML & CSS files) has very little relation (in most cases) to the code on the master and other branches in the repository. We follow the workflow originally recommended by GitHub, which involves creating an embedded separate clone of the repository with only the gh-pages branch. Using a separate clone to manage the gh-pages branch makes everything easier and less confusing/dangerous when there is zero code shared between the gh-pages branch and master (or other branches). When you embed the separate clone inside your working repository‚Äîin our case, always with the directory name web (see step (1) in the setup instructions below)‚Äîthis allows scripting tools to target the embedded clone/directory where the gh-pages branch is always checked out. In our case, every repository using GitBook contains the GitBook source Markdown files on master (often in a docs/ directory but also in other locations as necessary). Then the update-gh-pages.sh build script included in each repository runs the GitBook build tool to generate the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the embedded repository clone so that the build result ends up on the gh-pages branch where it needs to be to \"publish\" the site updates by pushing the branch up to the GitHub remote.\nTo set up this workflow for yourself, follow these steps:\n\nClone another copy of this repository, nested inside your top-level docs directory, but give it the name 'web': git clone git@github.com:tidepool-org/docs.git web. (The optional final argument to git clone tells git to name the cloned directory something other than the default repo name.)\nNavigate into the new clone with cd web/.\nCheckout the gh-pages branch in the new clone with git checkout gh-pages.\nDelete the master branch in the new clone since you will only be using this clone for managing the GitHub Pages code for the repo: git branch -d master.\nTest that you can view the GitHub Pages site locally by serving up the site to yourself (e.g., with the Python one-liner python -m SimpleHTTPServer) and viewing it in a browser.\n\n(Example given for this repository docs, but the same procedure is recommended for all Tidepool repos using GitBook, just substitute the repo name (e.g., chrome-uploader) for docs in the above instructions.)\nWhen you want to make changes to docs, you will branch from master and edit the source Markdown file(s), then open a pull request against master as usual. After the pull request is merged, simply run the update-gh-pages.sh script and follow the instructions at the conclusion of the script to navigate into web/ and check that the build was successful (e.g., step (5) above), that no non-HTML, CSS, or GitBook-related JavaScript files were incorrectly copied into the embedded cloneb, and then commit the changes and push gh-pages to the GitHub remote to \"publish\" the changes to the site.\nAdding or updating docs\nThe GitBook documentation is a good, well-organized resource, but the basics are very simple and summarized here.\nGitBook is a tool for compiling documentation from Markdown files. At Tidepool, thus far our only target for compilation is a static website that can be hosted on GitHub Pages, but GitBook offers other compilation targets, including PDF and e-reader formats.\nAt the top level, GitBook requires at minimum a README.md, which serves as the landing site for the documentation. (This README.md you are reading right now is thus the main page content for http://developer.tidepool.io/docs/index.html.) A SUMMARY.md is also required; the SUMMARY.md is where the docs are organized hierarchically, and one very nice thing about GitBook is that the hierarchy as described in the SUMMARY.md does not have to match the directory structure of the repository! If a Markdown file is not linked in the SUMMARY.md, it will not be compiled by GitBook (and may appear in your browser as plain Markdown), even if it is linked from another file that is linked in the SUMMARY.md. This issue of a missing link to a new file from the SUMMARY.md often surfaces with the error message \"[some page] contains an hyperlink to resource outside spine [unlinked Markdown file]\" during compilation. Basically, if you see that error, check the SUMMARY.md to make sure it includes everything it should.\nWithin each sub-directory of docs in your repository, it is conventional to include a README.md as the intro and table of contents for that sub-section of the documentation. In general, a typical GitBook structure (when one is matching directory structure to the SUMMARY.md, although this is not required) looks like the following:\n# Summary\n\n- [sandwich](sandwich/README.md)\n   + [bacon](sandwich/bacon.md)\n   + [lettuce](sandwich/lettuce.md)\n   + [tomato](sandwich/tomato.md)\n\nEvery repository (including this one) that uses GitBook will include scripts for serving the docs to yourself locally (in order to work on them) and to compile the docs, copying the result into the embedded clone of the repository used to manage the gh-pages branch (see Setting up your repo to work on docs above).\nTo serve the docs to yourself locally at http://localhost:4000/:\n$ npm run serve-docs\n\n(In this repository and the data model docs repository, the primary purpose of both of which is documentation, you can also serve the docs with npm start.)\nTo compile the docs to a static website and copy the result to the embedded clone of the repository in web/:\n$ npm run build-docs\n\nPublishing docs\nAfter building the docs with npm run build-docs, publishing the docs via GitHub Pages requires only a few additional steps:\n\nFirst, navigate to the embedded clone of the repo used for managing the gh-pages branch with cd web/.\n(If desired, preview the static site by serving it to yourself with a simple static server (e.g., the Python one-liner python -m SimpleHTTPServer).)\nCheck the changes with git diff or however you prefer to view changes. One thing to look out for here is irrelevant files that got synced - you may need to clear the changes inside web/, adjust the list of ignored files and directories in the .bookignore file, and rebuild the static site if files unnecessary for the static site (which should be just HTML files, outside of the CSS, JavaScript, and fonts provided under gitbook/) have been copied into web/.\nStage and commit the changes if you're happy with them.\nPublish to GitHub Pages by pushing your new commit(s) to the upstream gh-pages branch: git push origin gh-pages.\n\n\na. GitHub has since added a couple of far simpler methods, which are simply (a) including an index.html at the root level of your repository on master and choosing the appropriate repo setting to use that as the index for your GitHub Pages site or (b) including all static assets for your GitHub Pages site in a docs/ directory on master (again choosing the appropriate repo setting to tell GitHub to serve the files in this directory as your static site). Eventually perhaps it will make sense for us to upgrade to the simpler docs/ directory workflow, but at the moment with everything set up in the gh-pages branch workflow, investing the time to make the switch is not a high enough priority. (The gh-pages branch workflow also has the advantage of being somewhat cleaner when creating docs with GitBook since only the raw, source Markdown files are tracked on master, removing the potential for a mismatch between the source and compiled static assets, if both were tracked on master.) ‚Ü©\n\n\nb. If you do find non-GitBook HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the changes in the embedded clone, you may need to update the .bookignore file. ‚Ü©\n\n"},"GLOSSARY.html":{"url":"GLOSSARY.html","keywords":"","body":"\nBtUTC\nBootstrapping to UTC (BtUTC) is the algorithm Tidepool uses to infer UTC datetimes from the relative datetimes stored on diabetes devices in combination with the timezone of the most recent data on the device and the set of display time settings changes on the device.\nThe technical documentation for BtUTC resides in the uploader's docs, and there is also a less technical blog post.\n\ncalendar date\nAn object involving only date information‚Äîyear, month, and day‚Äîand referring to a date in the 365-day Gregorian calendar; represented best in ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD format.\nThe 365 day calendar is an abstraction that does not quite line up to universal time (i.e., UTC) because it guarantees exactly 365 days in a typical year and 366 in a leap year, while universal time does not (there are also leap seconds, etc. which add up to slightly more than 365 or 366 days). As a concept outside of universal time, a calendar date does not need or include timezone information.\nexamples\n2016-01-10 is a calendar date.

(18:05:00 would be the ISO 8601-formatted equivalent.) 64805000 is the same clock time in milliseconds.\nIn Tidepool front-end code, clock time is often computed from a datetime and then stored in milliseconds as msPer24.\n\ndatetime\nA \"datetime\" is our catchall term for an object involving both clock time information‚Äîhours, minutes, seconds, and possibly milliseconds‚Äîand date information‚Äîyear, month, and day.\nThe terms \"time\" and \"timestamp\" can be problematic and potentially confusing because they don't transparently represent the inclusion of date information. Thus, for maximum precision and clarity, we recommend using the term \"datetime\" when both clock time and date information are part of the object in question, both in documentation and in code.\nWe have borrowed this terminology with love from the datetime package in Python's standard library.\nexamples\nThe concept of right now, today, as you are reading this is a datetime. üòâ\ndeviceTime and time are both properties in the Tidepool data model that encode datetimes.\n\ndisplay time\nA display time is a type of relative datetime---that is, a datetime without timezone information and therefore not anchored to UTC.\nexamples\nIf you are a PwD, look at one of your diabetes devices right now; find the datetime display. Congratulations, unless you are looking at the time display on your iPhone for a Dexcom G5 system, you are looking at a display time.\n\nDST\nDaylight saving time (abbreviated DST) is the practice of advancing clock time by an hour during the summer months so that evening daylight lasts longer.\nMany timezones throughout the world observe DST, but some do not. Local governments decide exactly when the shift to and away from DST occurs.\nexamples\nThe major timezones‚ÄîPacific, Mountain, Central, and Eastern‚Äîin the continental United States all observe DST according to a federally-legislated schedule.
