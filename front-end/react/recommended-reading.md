For more information on what our current opinions and goals are regarding React best practices, refer to the following resources as noted:

- [A general list of React best practices](https://camjackson.net/post/9-things-every-reactjs-beginner-should-know '9 things every React.js beginner should know') (ignore the "for beginners").
- [Sift Science's advice on React best practices](https://engineering.siftscience.com/best-practices-for-building-large-react-applications/ 'Best practices for building large React applications'), especially the bits about single-responsibility components.
- [This blog post gives a useful comparison of ES5 vs. ES6 React Component classes](https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/06/07/react-on-es6-plus 'React on ES6+'), with the caveat that we try to keep to stateless functional components (see next point) *instead of classes* as much as possible.
- [The official React documentation for (stateless) functional components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html#functional-and-class-components 'React docs: Functional and Class Components').
- [Mixins Considered Harmful](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/13/mixins-considered-harmful.html 'Mixins Considered Harmful') is a great blog post to read from the React team, even though we never used mixins much (a few small ones *may* exist in blip): read the post instead for the great explanation of the "higher-order components" pattern as an alternative to mixins.
