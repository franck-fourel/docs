### (React +) Redux and performance

Just as [there are a few pitfalls](../react/performance.md) one can fall into, performance-wise, with any React application, there are a few more that crop up with the addition of Redux for state management. Redux itself is a very small library providing a state container API, and it is very fast. It's the connection with React where problems can occurâ€”or, in other words, the internals of [`react-redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux 'GitHub: react-redux'). A good place to start to understand potential performance issues is [this presentation](http://somebody32.github.io/high-performance-redux/ 'High-performance redux'), which includes a walk-through of the relevant `react-redux` code to aid in understanding the potential issues.
